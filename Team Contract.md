Communication: Team Meetings: Until November 8, we will meet once per week at 3:30pm on Friday at Grainger. Until due date, we will then meet twice a week Wednesday at 7:30pm and Friday at 3:30pm both on Grainger. Each meeting will last 2 hours. We will use GitHub to track all our progress. Jason (zekaiz2) will track minutes.

Assistance: We will be using a WeChat groupchat to contact each other should anything come up. Response times are at most a few hours.

Respect: At the beginning of each meeting we will propose ideas and every one will get the chance to speak their mind. A brainstorming session if you will.

Collaboration: Work Distribution: Jason (zekaiz2) will be the recorder, logging all the progress. We will figure out how to divide the task evenly among the other team memebers. If one cannot finish the task within a week, we will collaborate on the task. Go into office hours if we need any assistance there. Duke, Jacob, and Allen will be doing other tasks.

Time Commitment: Each week each member will try to give around 5 hours of dedication per week. We will work our schedules around this project. We will discuss how to rearrange the work to accomodate each other.

Conflict Resolution: Majority wins when we are discussing conflicts, and make a decision after a day and stick to one direction. We will try to make up the work not done and discuss how the team memebers who did not get done can do more. For habitually late memebers we will have them do squats. 1 squat for every minute they are late. We will deal with problems should and as they arise.

We agree to the contract above:

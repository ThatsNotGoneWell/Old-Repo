Progress:
	This week, we did two group meetings in person. During the first one, we have set up a git repository, written a basic Team Contract and established the way of communication. Then we spent some time brainstorming for an appropriate task for the final project. 
	We continued to brainstorm for a topic for our final project. We also signed the contract. At this point we are still ahead of our deadline.

Progress: We have received the email from our mentor, which means our team is finally official. The git repo is all setup and we have synced all the progess from the previous week to the new git repo. During the team meeting, we have settle for a topic for our team project and finished the project proposal. Overall, we have some good progress that helps us stick to the ideal timeline. As for the exact deadlines, we have finished all the files that needed to be submitted at the upcoming Monday (Nov 8th), and we are ready to get started on the project.

Next steps: README file; Data Acquisition

Progress: On Wednesday, we have received an email saying our proposal is rejected. Upon receving the email, we have discussed ways to resolve this issue using Wechat. Most issues are fixed on Wednesday, but we still need some clarifications, so we contacted our mentor. Unfortunately, we still haven't received any furthur response from our mentor through either Discord or email. Still, since the issues doesn't affect our leading questions or timeline, we carried on. A README file was made and we started Data Acuqisition as well as brainstorming a way to process the data and setting up a structure for our algorithm. We also set up a CodeShare file for us to work on the same piece of code at the same time. Overall, we are right on the timeline as long as the proposal can be approved after feedback from the tutor is received.

Progress: Over the past week, we have finally got approval from our mentor and implemented the graph algorithms, which takes the raw data, put it in a hash table and set up a graph according to the data. We also implemented a try-catch statement which is used to filter out the broken data, and as we expected, very few data entries were filered out. We didn't have much clue on the make file, and had some trouble making it up, but we have eventually fixed it witht he help of the office hour. Now our code can compile and branches are made so that we can work separately. We are basically caught up with the deadline, and we have plans to put in more work whenever possible during the break. Overall, our progress is pretty good.

Progress: During the thanksgiving week, we have made some progress on the project. Two of the the three algorithms that we worked on, JohnsonAlgo and Djikstras, are able to compile and run with some minor bugs. JohnsonAlgo couldn't process any large dataset, since it wasn't designed to do so. Djikstras algorithm is almost good, but priority queue wasn't used during the implementation of the algorithm. Thus, the time it takes is longer than it should. After the tahnksgiving break, we continued working on over project and also had our midpoint check, which wasn't very ideal. We didn't know that at least one complete algorithm has to be done, and got a penalty for that. Also, due to some difficulties on communication with our mentor, there were plenty of issues that we have to fix. During the midpoint check, we have decided to change JohnsonAlgo to visualization, which can be considered as an algorithm not covered on class and has been approved by our mentor. At 
the weekly meeting, we have fixed the project proposal accordingly. As for the algorithms, BFS is working properly and can be used to find the shortest path. Djisktras is still in progress and visualization is almost complete. Overall, we are ahead of the timeline.

Progress: In this final week, we wrapped up all the codes we have done and merged it into the main branch. Test cases were made to check every single airport in the generated path with the correct one. All the algorithms are working as intended, and all the deliverables are also made, including Final Project Report, Presentation video and README. Since we are keeping up with the timeline all this time, the project is almost finished at this point, and we expect to have it done a day before the deadline.

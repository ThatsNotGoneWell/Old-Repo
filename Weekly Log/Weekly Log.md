Progress:
	This week, we did two group meetings in person. During the first one, we have set up a git repository, written a basic Team Contract and established the way of communication. Then we spent some time brainstorming for an appropriate task for the final project. 
	We continued to brainstorm for a topic for our final project. We also signed the contract. At this point we are still ahead of our deadline.
